Along these lines, we have previously shown that the IL-8 gene is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner in cells that express the Tat protein, and the induction is during the S phase of the cell cycle and regulated by stable NF-kB binding to the IL-8 promoter [ 103 ] . When looking for IL-8 at the G1/S border, we found that all Tat containing cells, including PBMCs that were treated with exogenous Tat showed an up-regulation of IL-8 in the supernatant (Figure 4), further implying that results obtained from the H9/Tat system may infact be of general physiological relevance in vivo.</instance>
